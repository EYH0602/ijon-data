IJON is an annotation mechanism that analysts can use to guide fuzzers such as AFL. Using only a small (usually one line) annotation, one can help the fuzzer solve previously unsolvable challenges. For example, with this extension, a fuzzer is able to play and solve games such as Super Mario Bros. or resolve more complex patterns such as hash map lookups.
